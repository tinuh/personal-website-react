            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, I'm Tinu Vanapamula!
            I'm an 8th grader at Takoma Park Middle School and I'm very passionate about Computer Science.
            I have been interested in Computer Science ever since 6th grade.
            Since then, I have learned Python, Javascript, and HTML.
            With this knowledge I have been actively participating Computer Science Competitions.
            So far, in my career, I have won the congressional app challenge in Maryland's District MD-03.
            I developed a web-application called the Homework Manager.
            You can learn more about that <Link className="about-link" to="/homework-manager">Here</Link>.
            Additionally, I have participated in an Engineering Challenge at John's Hopkins Applied Physics lab.

            Additionally, One of my favorite hobbies is making media, I enjoy the art of video production because it is
            fun and I get to express myself.
